# Purpose of this Project 

Due to the fact that Naive Bayes is a relatively old and simple mashine learning tool itÂ´s usage is really powerfull for several classification tasks.
The code is covering tryouts (like a tutorial) to get an idea of the 'Multinomial Naive Bayes' and text based preprocessing tasks for classification of spam mails.
The same is performed within this code using Gaussian Naive Bayes for classifying species on the IRIS dataset on a probabilistic way.

Validation and Qualtiy Control show that the algorithm is compared to other mashine learning relatively easy to master with excellent metric results.
